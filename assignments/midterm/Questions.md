#### Sparse-matrix dense-matrix product


**Q**
How
does the performance (in GFLOP/s) for sparse-matrix by dense matrix product (**SPMM**) compare 
to sparse-matrix by vector product (**SPMV**)?
The performance for SPMM should be about the same as for SPMV in the case of a 1 column dense matrix.  
What is the trend with increasing numbers of columns?  




**Q**
How
does the performance of SPMM (in GFLOP/s) compare to the results you got dense matrix-matrix product in previous assignments?   There
should be a fairly large difference in GFLOP/s between sparse and dense matrix
methods.  Give some reasons for such a big difference.



#### Compressed sparse column

**Q** 
How
does the performance of SPMM (in GFLOP/s) compare to the results you got dense matrix-matrix product in previous assignments?   There
should be a fairly large difference in GFLOP/s between sparse and dense matrix
methods.  Give some reasons for such a big difference.


**Q**
How does the performance of CSC compare to the performance of CSR and of COO?  
Explain why (or why not) there are any significant differences.


#### Array of structs

**Q**
How does the performance of AOS compare to the performance of  COO?  
Explain why (or why not) there are any significant differences.
